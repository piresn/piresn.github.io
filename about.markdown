I graduated in Biology in Lisbon and made a PhD at the John Innes Centre and University of Oxford. In 2011 I moved to Switzerland, where I was a researcher and lecturer at the University of Zurich. In 2018 I moved to Germany to join BI X, the digital lab of Boehringer Ingelheim, as a Data Scientist.
