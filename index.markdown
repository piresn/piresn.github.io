# Hi,

I am a Senior Data Scientist working at BI X, the digital lab of Boehringer Ingelheim.

I studied Biotechnology in Lisbon and made a PhD in Evolutionary Biology at the John Innes Centre and University of Oxford. In 2011 I moved to Switzerland, where I was a researcher and lecturer at the University of Zurich. In 2018 I moved to Germany to join BI X and develop digital solutions for drug discovery and digital health.
